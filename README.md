# Trendr - Stay Ahead of the News


## Project Description: Trendr

Trendr is a powerful news application that keeps you updated and ahead of the latest news stories. It offers a wide range of features for both users and administrators. Users can create accounts, personalize their news preferences, and explore news summaries from various categories. The application provides top tweets based on user news preferences and highlights trending news headlines, regardless of individual preferences.

## Features I built:

1. **Personalized News Feed**: Users can view news summaries on their news feed based on their selected preferences.

2. **News Search**: Users can search for news articles by keywords and categories, making it easy to find specific news items.

3. **AI-Powered News Summaries**: Fetch news summaries using OpenAI GPT-3.5, enhancing the news reading experience.

4. **Social Interaction**: Users can like, comment, and share news articles, fostering engagement and discussion.

5. **Bookmark Articles**: Users can save/bookmark articles for later reading, ensuring they never miss important news.
